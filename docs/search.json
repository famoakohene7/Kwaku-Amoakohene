    "text": "About\nI am Abraham Ayiah Yankson, a master of arts in economics student at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Department of Economics. I also hold bachelor of arts degree in economics from the University of Ghana, Legon. I believe the intensity of poverty in many regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, requires economic modelling and research to inform policy-making in these regions. As Data analytics enthusiast and a budding applied-microeconomist, i have strong interest in modelling labour market dynamics, Poverty and inequality."
